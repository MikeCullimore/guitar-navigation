# guitar-navigation

Draw dots on the fretboard to help with finding your way around.

## TODO

* Semantic input e.g. G chord: each note has string, fret, note name and scale degree.
* Inputs are array of dots with common styling. Handle semantics elsewhere.
* Animate (input is array of arrays of positions ... also with timings?).
* Common base component for fretboard, call with # strings, # frets for guitars, bass, ukelele.
